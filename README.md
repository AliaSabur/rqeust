## Usage

This asynchronous example uses [Tokio](https://tokio.rs) and enables some
optional features, so your `Cargo.toml` could look like this:

HTTP

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
rquest = "1.0.0"
```

```rust,no_run
use rquest::tls::Impersonate;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), rquest::Error> {
    // Build a client to mimic Chrome131
    let client = rquest::Client::builder()
        .impersonate(Impersonate::Chrome131)
        .build()?;

    // Use the API you're already familiar with
    let resp = client.get("https://tls.peet.ws/api/all").send().await?;
    println!("{}", resp.text().await?);

    Ok(())
}
```

WebSocket

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
rquest = { version = "1.0.0", features = ["websocket"] }
futures-util = { version = "0.3.0", default-features = false, features = ["std"] }
```

```rust,no_run
use futures_util::{SinkExt, StreamExt, TryStreamExt};
use rquest::{tls::Impersonate, Client, Message};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), rquest::Error> {
    // Build a client to mimic Chrome131
    let client = Client::builder()
        .impersonate(Impersonate::Chrome131)
        .build()?;

    // Use the API you're already familiar with
    let websocket = client
        .websocket("wss://echo.websocket.org")
        .send()
        .await?
        .into_websocket()
        .await?;

    let (mut tx, mut rx) = websocket.split();

    tokio::spawn(async move {
        for i in 1..11 {
            tx.send(Message::Text(format!("Hello, World! #{i}")))
                .await
                .unwrap();
        }
    });

    while let Some(message) = rx.try_next().await? {
        match message {
            Message::Text(text) => println!("received: {text}"),
            _ => {}
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}

```

## Overview

The predecessor of rquest is [reqwest](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest). rquest is a specialized adaptation based on the reqwest project, supporting [BoringSSL]() and related `HTTP/2` fingerprints in requests.

It also optimizes commonly used APIs and enhances compatibility with connection pools, making it easier to switch proxies, `IP` addresses, and interfaces. You can directly migrate from a project using reqwest to rquest.

Due to limited time for maintaining the synchronous APIs, only asynchronous APIs are supported. I may have to give up maintenance; if possible, please consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/penumbra-x/.github/blob/main/profile/SPONSOR.md).

## Connection Pool

Regarding the design strategy of the connection pool, `rquest` and `reqwest` are implemented differently. `rquest` reconstructs the entire connection layer, treating each host with the same proxy or bound `IP`/`Interface` as the same connection, while `reqwest` treats each host as an independent connection. Specifically, the connection pool of `rquest` is managed based on the host and `proxy`/`IP`/`Interface`, while the connection pool of `reqwest` is managed only by the host. In other words, when using `rquest`, you can flexibly switch between proxies, `IP` or `Interface` without affecting the management of the connection pool.

> `Interface` refers to the network interface of the device, such as `wlan0` or `eth0`.

## Root Certificate

By default, `rquest` uses Mozilla's root certificates through the `webpki-roots` crate. This is a static root certificate bundle that is not automatically updated. It also ignores any root certificates installed on the host running `rquest`, which may be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your point of view. But you can turn off `default-features` to cancel the default certificate bundle, and the system default certificate path will be used to load the certificate. In addition, `rquest` also provides a certificate store for users to customize the update certificate.

## Device

You can customize the `TLS`/`HTTP2` fingerprint parameters of the device. In addition, the basic device impersonation types are provided as follows:

- **Chrome**

`Chrome100`ï¼Œ`Chrome101`ï¼Œ`Chrome104`ï¼Œ`Chrome105`ï¼Œ`Chrome106`ï¼Œ`Chrome107`ï¼Œ`Chrome108`ï¼Œ`Chrome109`ï¼Œ`Chrome114`ï¼Œ`Chrome116`ï¼Œ`Chrome117`ï¼Œ`Chrome118`ï¼Œ`Chrome119`ï¼Œ`Chrome120`ï¼Œ`Chrome123`ï¼Œ`Chrome124`ï¼Œ`Chrome126`ï¼Œ`Chrome127`ï¼Œ`Chrome128`ï¼Œ`Chrome129`ï¼Œ`Chrome130`ï¼Œ`Chrome131`

- **Edge**

`Edge101`ï¼Œ`Edge122`ï¼Œ`Edge127`ï¼Œ`Edge131`

- **Safari**

`SafariIos17_2`ï¼Œ`SafariIos17_4_1`ï¼Œ`SafariIos16_5`ï¼Œ`Safari15_3`ï¼Œ`Safari15_5`ï¼Œ`Safari15_6_1`ï¼Œ`Safari16`ï¼Œ`Safari16_5`ï¼Œ`Safari17_0`ï¼Œ`Safari17_2_1`ï¼Œ`Safari17_4_1`ï¼Œ`Safari17_5`ï¼Œ`Safari18`ï¼Œ`SafariIPad18`, `Safari18_2`, `Safari18_1_1`

- **OkHttp**

`OkHttp3_9`ï¼Œ`OkHttp3_11`ï¼Œ`OkHttp3_13`ï¼Œ`OkHttp3_14`ï¼Œ`OkHttp4_9`ï¼Œ`OkHttp4_10`ï¼Œ`OkHttp5`

- **Firefox**

`Firefox109`, `Firefox133`

> It is not supported for Firefox device that use http2 priority frames. If anyone is willing to help implement it, please submit a patch to the [h2](https://github.com/penumbra-x/h2) repository.

## Requirement

Install the environment required to build [BoringSSL](https://github.com/google/boringssl/blob/master/BUILDING.md)

Do not compile with crates that depend on `OpenSSL`; their prefixing symbols are the same and may cause linking [failures](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/issues/2010).

If both `OpenSSL` and `BoringSSL` are used as dependencies simultaneously, even if the compilation succeeds, strange issues may still arise.

If you prefer compiling for the `musl target`, it is recommended to use the [tikv-jemallocator](https://github.com/tikv/jemallocator) memory allocator; otherwise, multithreaded performance may be suboptimal. Only available in version 0.6.0, details: https://github.com/tikv/jemallocator/pull/70

## Building

```shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake perl pkg-config libclang-dev musl-tools -y

cargo build --release
```

You can also use [this GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/penumbra-x/rquest/blob/main/.github/compilation-guide/build.yml) to compile your project on **Linux**, **Windows**, and **macOS**.
